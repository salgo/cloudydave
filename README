Cloudy Dave is a server monitoring tool for the cloud environment.

Various test can be configured per host to do various tests of both
themselves and services on other hosts

This branch houses the rewrite into datastore agnostic code (starting
with an example implementation with MongoDB). This means that remote 
clients will now be expected to report back to the server via a REST 
PUT. This is being done as it's proved difficult to run a basic setup
on Amazon Simple DB in the free usage layer - which was basically the
idea. I will revisit this as I've got ideas for optimization but the
entire project depending on one closed technology isn't where I want
it to be.

It's at the very stages and although I have had running on a few hosts
I'd use something else for now.
