Cloudy Dave is a server monitoring tool for the cloud environment.

Various hosts can be configure per host to do various tests of both themselves and services on other hosts

Currently, data is stored in Amazon Web Services Simple DB system. Alerts are sent with Twillio.

It's at the very stages and although I have had running on a few hosts I'd use something else for now.
